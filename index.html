          Our main objectives for this project were to analyze and identify
          flaws in an existing interface, implement the design process in
          creating improved prototypes, and build a responsive website. We were
          additionally challenged to create our sites using only HTML and CSS.
          <br />

          The original site has since been taken down. My version can be found
          {here}.

        <h2>Part 1: Identifying Usability Problems</h2>

        <p>
          I chose to redesign the website for a local bagel shop – when I first
          found it, I was shocked at how antiquated and disorganized it was. I
          noticed the following in analyzing its usability:
          <br />
          <br />
          Additionally, it had extremely poor accessibility. WebAIM WAVE noted
          issues in almost every possible category, including a lack of ARIA
          labels, problems with color contrast, and a complete absence of
          structural elements. I completely agree with its assessment, and began
          my work to create a new and improved site.

        <h2>Part 2: Visual Redesign</h2>
        <p>
          With my notes on the existing site complete, it was time to begin the
          visual redesign process. I began with speed sketching, a series of
          nine one-minute sketches to generate ideas. Combining elements from
          various sketches, I integrated these into a final design sketch.

        <p>
          With a general idea of my design, I moved over to Figma, where I began
          with low-fidelity wireframing. I focused on improving the features I had originally noted as lacking in usability.

        <p>
          Using these wireframes as a base, I then created a style guide and a
          high-fidelity mockup that represented the polished version of what I
          wanted the site to look like for various screen sizes.

        <h2>Part 3: Responsive Redesign</h2>
        <p>
          Finally, it was time to code my site! This was easily the most complex
          visual interface I’ve attempted, so there was definitely a learning
          curve when it came to the more difficult flexbox or aesthetic
          components. Making the introduction section responsive gave me a lot
          of trouble – I had four elements (the image, header, text, and
          button), and I struggled to switch around their placement to replicate
          my prototypes and ensure usability across all three screen sizes .
          After much effort, coding, and re-coding, I finally reached a site
          that I feel confident is much-improved from the original, and offers a
          far more usable and effective experience for users.

          Overall, this was a valuable learning experience in the practical
          implementation of the design process.
