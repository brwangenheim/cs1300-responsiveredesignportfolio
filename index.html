          Our main objectives for this project were to analyze and identify
          flaws in an existing interface, implement the design process in
          creating improved prototypes, and build a responsive website. We were
          additionally challenged to create our sites using only HTML and CSS.

          The original site has since been 
          <a href="bagelgourmetcafe.com" target="_blank"> taken down.</a>
          My version can be found

        <h2>Part 1: Identifying Usability Problems</h2>

        <p>
          I chose to redesign the website for a local bagel shop – when I first
          found it, I was shocked at how antiquated and disorganized it was. I
          noticed the following in analyzing its usability:
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>There was very inconsistent visual hierarchy (including text hierarchy) and sections were disorganized.</li>
            <li>Fonts and colors had no real patterns or logic to them.</li>
            <li>Elements moved around the page with almost zero consistency. The navigation bar shifted from top to side, the header disappeared and reappeared, and more.</li>
            <li>The page was not at all responsive, and elements were shrunk to an illegible size when browser size was changed.</li>
            <li>Finding practical information was extremely difficult. I was unable to find how to order or view a functional menu.</li>
        </ul>
          Additionally, it had extremely poor accessibility. WebAIM WAVE noted
          issues in almost every possible category, including a lack of ARIA
          labels, problems with color contrast, and a complete absence of
          structural elements. I completely agree with its assessment, and began
          my work to create a new and improved site.

        <h2>Part 2: Visual Redesign</h2>
        <p>
          With my notes on the existing site complete, it was time to begin the
          visual redesign process. I began with speed sketching, a series of
          nine one-minute sketches to generate ideas. Combining elements from
          various sketches, I integrated these into a final design sketch.

        <p>
          With a general idea of my design, I moved over to Figma, where I began
          with low-fidelity wireframing. I focused on improving the features I had originally noted as lacking in usability.
        </p>
        <img src="low_fidelity_mockup.png" alt="Low-fidelity mockup" />
        <p>
          Using these wireframes as a base, I then created a style guide and a
          high-fidelity mockup that represented the polished version of what I
          wanted the site to look like for various screen sizes.

        <h2>Part 3: Responsive Redesign</h2>
        <p>
          Finally, it was time to code my site! This was easily the most complex
          visual interface I’ve attempted, so there was definitely a learning
          curve when it came to the more difficult flexbox or aesthetic
          components. Making the overview section responsive gave me a lot
          of trouble – I had four elements (the image, header, text, and
          button), and I struggled to switch around their placement to replicate
          my prototypes and ensure usability across all three screen sizes, and 
          I had to get creative with my button elements to problem solve. The 
          phone one still isn't my favorite, and I'd love to work some more on 
          this site (especially implementing JS features) to make it more dynamic.
           However, after much effort, coding, and 
          re-coding, I finally reached a site that I feel confident is much-improved
           from the original, and offers a far more usable and effective experience 
           for users. In order, these are my site in computer, tablet, and phone dimensions.

      </br/>
        <p> 
          In testing for responsiveness and accessibility, alongside testing its
           appearance on various browser sizes and devices, I tried changing the 
          font size on my browser and looking at WebAim WAVE for any accessibility issues. 
          WebAIM showed no issues, and though the text size interferes with some of the 
          aesthetics of formatting (again mostly in the intro section, which 
         would greatly benefit from the use of JS elements), the site is still highly usable.

          Overall, this projected offered a valuable learning experience in the practical
          implementation of the design process. This was my first time going 
          through such a rigorous prototyping process, so I learned the value 
          of planning and having a clear design vision, as it helped streamline 
          the redesign process and ensure consistency across different stages. 
          Additionally, through my struggle in implementing the flexboxes, I 
          realized that taking a step back to ensure I truly understand the concepts 
          I implement is far more rewarding than relying solely on trial and 
          error. Finally, I better understand the comprehensiveness and complexity 
          in creating an (even very simple) accessible, responsive website, and have greater appreciation 
          for the value that that attention to detail and user-centric design principles 
          bring to the development process. Though there's still room for improvement, 
          I am proud of my final product and excited to continue working on effective design.
